    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": {
        "question": "What is BlockRoots in simple terms?",
        "answer": "BlockRoots is like a community-owned cryptocurrency mining project. You buy $ROOT tokens, and they let you share the profits from mining digital coins, all while helping decide how the project grows. It’s simple, transparent, and open to everyone!"
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How do I join BlockRoots?",
        "answer": "Just grab some $ROOT tokens during our ICO (starting at $0.01 in pre-sale). Hold them to earn a cut of the mining profits—up to 15% monthly after 6 months—or stake them for extra rewards. That’s it, you’re in!"
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What are the $ROOT tokens for?",
        "answer": "$ROOT tokens are your key to BlockRoots. They let you earn mining profits (5-15% monthly based on how long you hold), vote on project decisions, and stake for extra tokens. They’re the fuel of our decentralized ecosystem."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How does the profit-sharing work technically?",
        "answer": "Profits from mined cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) are converted to a stablecoin monthly. These are then distributed to $ROOT holders based on holding duration: 5% for 1-3 months, 10% for 3-6 months, and 15% for 6+ months, proportional to your token amount."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What’s the 5% transaction tax used for?",
        "answer": "Every $ROOT trade has a 5% tax, split as: 2% to upgrade mining hardware, 1% for operational costs, 1% for marketing, and 1% redistributed as rewards to holders. It’s a self-sustaining mechanism to grow the farm and benefit the community."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How are the $ROOT tokens distributed?",
        "answer": "Out of 1 billion $ROOT tokens: 40% go to the ICO, 20% fund the mining farm, 10% are for the team (locked for 3 months), 10% for community rewards, 10% for marketing, and 10% as a reserve for future growth."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "What happens if I miss the ICO?",
        "answer": "No worries! After the ICO, you can still buy $ROOT tokens on exchanges once they’re listed (planned for Phase 4). You’ll still earn profits and rewards, though ICO buyers get the best price ($0.01-$0.02)."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "How does staking affect my rewards and governance?",
        "answer": "Staking locks your $ROOT tokens to earn extra $ROOT rewards (beyond the 5-15% profit share). It also boosts your voting power in governance, with staked tokens giving you priority in proposing and deciding on farm upgrades."
      }
